The second day at Smith Rocks I woke up early, around 6, and got to the park right around 7, when it opened.

Here's the view on the drive over:

I purchased my day pass and set up in the outer lot, with a great view of the cliffs. I was the first one there, and so I was able to use the freshly cleaned porta potty and pick the best spot in the parking lot, which for me was a spot with a no parking spot on the passenger side, so I can swing my doors open and cook and work outside.

Here's the view right when I got there:

I got set up, went out along the rim trail and got some photos of the sunrise on the rocks.

There was a couple paraglider zipping around the canyon

And then a hot air ballon appeared, there's a paraglider above the balloon in this photo:

I made some oatmeal and coffee for breakfast. I took some photos to show you some of my process.

After breakfast I got to work. But today it was special.

After work I went bouldering and took absolutely no pictures of it... I also didn't have any real guide, since I didn't want to spend forty dollars for the guidebook when I would only be there a short while. I did look up a text guide to some of the boulders and worked out where one was that had some relatively easy problems on it. I am weak from not climbing in a long time, and that being added to my still raw ring finger (electric drill incident for those of you not in the know) and aloneness, I didn't top out on anything. I didn't really even get more than four feet off the ground. But I climbed till the sun went down over the canyon wall and the valley began to get cold, a breeze running through it. Then I hiked back out and set off towards Sisters, Oregon, with the goal of doing some biking in the Deschutes National Forest.
