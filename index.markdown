# Driving From Monroe to Tieton

I drove from rainy, foggy Monroe WA the other day (October 3rd) over Snoqualmie Pass on I-90. I pulled over at a rest stop (Indian John) to use the restroom and felt tired, so I slept an hour. I woke up around 7 and decided to just stay overnight in the rest area parking lot. I ate some of the pizza I made (see the photo in the last post!), watched an episode of Squid Game, and went to bed.

The next day (October 4th), I woke up and drove a bit down the road to a local coffee shop, got some coffee and a breakfast sandwich, and worked till just before noon. While I was there one of the workers sliced off the tip of their finger with a mandolin while cutting onions ðŸ˜¬ I passed on some insights from my recent drill-related injury. They won't have a fun time the first time they take off the bandage, hopefully they figure out how to get it off without it sticking/hurting too much.

After work I drove to Tieton (pronounced Tie-eh-tawn), northwest of Yakima. I met up with some friends of the family, the Claussens. Phil was the only one home and he's got a bad cold, so I didn't talk to him for too long, but caught him up on what I and my siblings have been up to. I then went for a bike ride through the hills to the east of Tieton. The paved roads quickly give way to gravel on most routes out of town, and then after crossing and passing a couple gates, the gravel increased to the size of my head. It was quite the adventure, and it was a hot slog to the top of the mountain. Once I was on the ridgeline there was a nice breeze though, and I picked my way to the other end, where the comically large gravel finally started to subside. From there there was a beautiful descent with gorgeous views of Tieton River. I made my way all the way down to Highway 12 at Windy Point. The route I was following kept going, following the river farther east before heading back into the hills and looping back north and ending about halfway back to the 410-12 junction. It was about 4 at that point though and I was worried about it getting dark. I hadn't brought any lights. I rode 12 north then east, and then south and west back into Tieton. There's a pretty good climb from Naches up towards Tieton and a couple other rolling hills coming into town, and overall I was tuckered by the time I got back. Having not been on a bike in... months? -- 30+ miles was biting off a bit more than I could chew.

Here's the ride:

I'll leave you with some pictures.

# Leaving Tieton and Highway 97

On the fifth I worked till 1pm or so at the Claussen's, and Beth made me breakfast and lunch. Then, just before I left, she baked chocolate chip cookies and gave me a bunch. I'm a sucker for food so I'll definitely be stopping by on my way back to Washington ðŸ˜Š

Down from Tieton into Naches I went, and then from Highway 12 to Highway 97, which I'll be taking all the way to Klamath Falls, where I'll be visiting my Uncle David. I drove for a couple hours and stopped on the Columbia River at Maryhill State Park.

There, I waded a bit in the water and had dinner -- a burrito crisped on my stove and cookies. After eating and brushing my teeth, I started South once more (almost immediately entering Oregon, since the border is halfway over the Columbia). Soon after crossing the river, there was a sign: "Next Gas 94 Miles." I had about a quarter of my front tank and a full (or so I thought) rear tank. That's enough to make it... right?

A quick break since I've been calculating my MPG since I headed out from the Seattle area. Let me tell you, it's not pretty. As in 7 miles per gallon ugly. Oh well, I love and hate the old girl in equal measure. I wouldn't have it any other way -- I'm not trying to live the "van life" or experience great comfort in my travels. That's no fun.

Anyways, so knowing that I get 7 MPG (I didn't really know that then, I would have guessed at least 8), and the front tank holding 22 gallons and the rear holding 13 (?)... I'll let you do the math because I'm too lazy. Anyways, it was all too soon that I found my front tank empty, and then my rear tank sure did go down fast.

But then again, I know that. The rear leaks into the front because the valve that controls which tank the engine draws from and returns to works for the former but not the latter. So it goes down quick and then I switch back to the front and use whatever is in there. Sometimes I empty the front, use the rear, and when I fill up the next time the front only takes 5 gallons or so.

And then... I stopped on the side of the road cause I was sleepy, watched the rest of Squid Game (meh ending), and bedded down for the night. Though I don't have my father's gift for sleep, cars and semis can't keep me awake even when they're passing by all night right next to me.

Guess we'll find out if I made it, or how close I got before I ran out of gas, next time.
